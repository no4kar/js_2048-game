# 2048 Game
Welcome to the classic 2048 game implementation! Play now: 2048 Game

## Description:
This project is an implementation of the popular 2048 game using JavaScript. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game continues until the grid is full or the player achieves the 2048 tile.

## Features:
1) Smooth and intuitive gameplay experience.
2) Responsive design, playable on both desktop and mobile devices.
3) Score tracking to keep track of your progress.
4) Ability to restart the game at any time.

## How to Play:
- Use the arrow keys or swipe gestures (on mobile) to move the tiles in the desired direction.
- Tiles with the same number merge when they collide, doubling their value.
- Continue merging tiles strategically to reach the elusive 2048 tile.
